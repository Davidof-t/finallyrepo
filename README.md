# Secure Healthcare Data Management System on Azure 

This project was created specifically for my job interview with Florida Blue. The goal was not only to demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and manage a secure, HIPAA-compliant healthcare data management system using Azure, leveraging Terraform for IaC

Beyond showcasing my technical skills, this project represents my commitment to learning and pushing myself beyond my current capabilities. I have tailored this project to align closely with the job description, not only to highlight my skills but to demonstrate my eagerness to learn and challenge myself. For me, this is more than just a job-it's an opportunity to fulfill my dream of becoming an engineer. I hope this project reflects the dedication and 110% effort I bring to every task I undertake.
